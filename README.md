> Ana Costa and Srikar Pottabathula

### Setup
In order to execute the IPYNB file, the IAM_TrOCR Dataset must be downloaded from the following link:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/changheonkim/iam-trocr](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/changheonkim/iam-trocr)    
Once the data has been downloaded, place the data in the appropriate locations like so:
```
|--- HTR_final_project.ipynb
|--- gt_test.txt
|--- images
     |--- < 2,915 image files >
```
The model is now ready to be executed block by block as an IPYNB file.
